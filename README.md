Welcome to The Machine Project
===================
***Welcome to the machine...***

Sorry, we couldn't resist the joke. This project is a very, very minor simulation of `The Machine` from *Person of Interest*, perhaps one of the best TV shows ever.

Here is the original inspiration for the project [Reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonOfInterest/comments/39z1st/i_started_building_a_machine/).

You can keep up-to-date with most project developments [at our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/themachineproject).

Our website is [here!](http://www.themachineproject.org)

As more development is done, we will continue to update this repository, but for now, here are our targeted goals:

* Facial (isolation)? for the machine; isolating a face from surroundings.
* More UI animations and enhancements, giving a *Person of Interest* feel for the project.

Future goals include:

* Facial recognition, i.e. recognizing admins, aux admins, and others.
* Multiple platform support for the project; Windows, Linux, Android, IPhone.

Feel free to follow or fork this project. As always, making such a project is a lot of work, and any help is welcome. Please feel free to create issues and contribute to the project.

TL;DR *Welcome to the machine...*
